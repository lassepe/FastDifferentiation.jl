"""Holds information for factorable subgraph that is both a dom and pdom."""



"""
Finds the factorable dom subgraph associated with `node_index` if there is one.  

Given vertex `node_index` and the idom table for root `rᵢ`
find `a=idom(b)`. `a` is guaranteed to be in in the subset of the ℝⁿ->ℝᵐ graph reachable from root `rᵢ` because otherwise it would not be in the idom table associated with `rᵢ`.

The subgraph `(a,b)` is factorable if there are two or more parent edges of `b` which are both on the path to root `ri`.  

Proof: 
For `(a,b)` to be factorable there must be at least two paths from `a` downward to `b` and at least two paths upward from `b` to `a`. Because `a=idom(b)` we only need to check the latter case. If this holds then there must also be two paths downward from `a` to `b`. 

Proof:

Assume `a` has only one child. Since `a=idom(b)` all upward paths from `b` must pass through `a`. Since `a` has only one child, `nᵢ`, all paths from `b` must first pass through `nᵢ` before passing through `a`. But then `nᵢ` would be the idom of `b`, not `a`, which violates `a=idom(b)`. Hence there must be two downward paths from `a` to `b`.
